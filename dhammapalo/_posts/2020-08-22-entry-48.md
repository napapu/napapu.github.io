I tried to eat as much as I could yesterday so I still don't understand why I'm still losing weight. I wish I could have this problem when I return to lay life. Also, I will need to apply anti-mosquito repellent in the morning too before morning chanting. Warmer temperatures mean that they are out in full force and not being allowed to kill means that you're at its mercy.

Tan Ajahn has a few appointments and outings in the coming days and the one that I would like to attend is on Saturday. It's a day trip to [Wat Phra That Pranom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Phra_That_Phanom){:target="_blank"} and apparently Tan Ajahn goes 4-5 times a year. All the other monks have been several times so there doesn't seem to be much enthusiasm for it. It clashes with robe washing and head shaving so I plan to ask someone to help shave in advance.
