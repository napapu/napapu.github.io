Only a short entry as I'm getting used to the routine now, although the sleep was terrible. I'm slowly getting used to the route for the alms round but nothing will prevent walking bare-foot from being excrutiating at first I'm sure. The handyman on the route was telling all the lay people that we came across that it will be an off day tomorrow. This is because it will be the ordination day and my parents will be providing the monks with the food for the morning so they won't come on the alms round.

The day itself was completely dedicated to learning the Ukasa until the parents came. The hawker stores were so packed and parking hard to come by that we ended up going out. Somehow we decided on the Pizza Company as the last meal that I will be having for a while by choice. Their Korean style fried chicken wasn't all that bad so I was glad for that. My uncle came to visit for a little while after.

After the evening chanting, the monks helped me with the rehersal for tomorrow. It went absolutely fine. The funny thing was the monks didn't really know the exact ordering themselves either so it looks like we'll all be playing it by ear. I've been reassured that the preceptor monk (the one in charge of the ordination procedure) is rather relaxed so I shouldn't need to worry.
