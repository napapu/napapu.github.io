It was with deep sense of guilt when I started the day and carried out the alms round wearing sandals. Tan N. explicitly made the point to me as we were leaving (_You are wearing shoes_, said he) but my excuse was that I had to travel today. The real reason was that the walk was so painful yesterday and the blisters have yet to recover so I wanted a rest. I was considering not doing the alms round at all but I thought between that and doing it with shoes, the lay people would understand as they would also notice that I was the new monk.

Afterwards we had breakfast and then said my farewells to the abbot. My parents picked me up and we left for Don Mueng airport at 10am. Here I managed to get one last fried chicken meal (provided for by my parents of course as monks can't buy their own food). Thai people's respect for monks still exists in so many places. All the airport staff seemed especially courteous and the women made sure to keep their distance (it is forbidden for monks to touch women at all).

The flight was fast and I had a seat in the front row. Unfortunately since I was still a newbie when it came to keeping my robes on I had to ask the flight attendant to help store my travel bag above because I was afraid that my clothes would fall off in the process.

I finally got the Baan Por and it was a blissfully calm sanctuary. I finally met Ajahn Jayasaro again and straight away he taught me the protocol, about how to don my clothes properly and bow three times when meeting a more senior monk. He also taught me the proper way of folding the main robe properly to carry it over your shoulder.

Then he proceeded to tell me about all the rules that I should've been told about straight after ordination regarding serious offences that could lead to expulsion from the practice. They didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary and rather common sense to me given the level of discipline required for the practice. I got the air that he could be a rather serious and strict teacher should the need arise.

I am beginning to have second thoughts as my assumption was that there would be a lot more focus on the â€˜practice' which I took to mean meditation and mindfulness. It's early days yet so I'm keeping an open mind. I'm sharing a room with a novice monk and it was evident straight away that he's being doing this for much longer than I have.

I soon met another senior monk from the next room and was reprimanded as I left my alms bowl near my feet. As an object of respect, it should be kept next to your head. Also the lid must be placed in a certain way to let the bowl be properly aired after washing. Every chat with the novice monk would induce a sense of guilt as each time he would display a great deal of respect which I was absolutely unworthy of. He also seems to have the magical ability to wake up at 3 or 4am daily without an alarm clock.

On second thoughts this place is not as peaceful as I thought as you can hear ambulances going by with some regularity. There's also either a bar or restaurant nearby blaring country music in the evening. The novice monk seems to keep a diary as well. Either that or he's learning some chants that I should also really know.

The moment he stepped in I could picture the scene where we would somehow be compared but I think the only way to avoid that is to keep to myself and focus on the practice the best I can. The novice monk does have an absurdly flexible back as he can sit cross legged and bend down to write in front of him. The night is going to be cold and I feel very sorry for him since he doesn't have a hat.
