The day began with layman S. being initiated into a _pa kao_ (ผ้าขาว literally _white cloth_). It was similar to my monk ordination where he had to recite some chants and precepts in Pali. Then the abbot gave a talk about what the implications were now that he had taken up these precepts and the expectations and obligations of the new life against the old. A very contemplative affair and he peppered his talk with jokes to keep everyone engaged and awake in the early hours. The walk to the station was painful as usual, always around the first 20%. This time it was only three of us and Tan S. was mindful of our slow pace. We didn't walk through the carpark at the end either which was a huge relief.

It was a normal day today but since the weather had gotten warmer, millions of small insects flew about and flooded the sala. We noticed too late and even with the lights turned off they swarmed all over us. I thought it was impossible to do any meditation in that state so I left and went back to my kuti. They followed me there too and there were quite a few flying around inside. The eucalyptus spray worked wonders but there was no way to keep them all away.
