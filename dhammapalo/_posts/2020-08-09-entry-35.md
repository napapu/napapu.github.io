Today was the first time going on an alms round with Ajahn K. As expected, he's a pro. He kindly asked that I should tell him to speed up or slow down as required. The problem was that he was able to maintain a consistent speed throughout. What may seem slow during the easier surfaces was fast on the tough parts. My feet ended up even more battered than usual. He's a very nice guy though and more talkative than the other monks.

He suggested the idea of ordaining more seriously and we had a good chat. I mainly said that I had other priorities for now but honestly it was difficult to think straight as I was in pain from the walk. As peaceful and content as I've become, I feel that I already have a good lay life for now. There's suffering definitely but I'm not sure I'm willing to give it all up quite yet. At this rate my knees will give out before I make it even 2 months.

Since I was so exhausted I fell asleep after breakfast. The weather was accommodating so I slept for almost 2 hours. I was better prepared last night from the cold and closing the windows definitely helped, but I still woke up at times.
