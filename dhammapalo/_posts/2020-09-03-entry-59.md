My parents came to visit and I met them on the way out to the alms round as someone forgot to unlock the gate. Mum got out when I asked if she wanted to follow me on the alms round. I think she took a lot of photos. I didn't tell Tan B. who was leading but I'm pretty sure he realised as he went at a very compassionate pace. My weight went up today but it was the result of severely overeating yesterday. I can't do that again as I had to walk very quickly to reach the toilet before an accident.

I had a nice chat with my parents and they were slightly concerned with my weight loss. This was to be expected given that they last saw me over a month ago. They spent a while informing me about the outside world with the coronavirus and all which is fair enough because I will be going out to face that soon. They offered three big rolls of cloth to the monastery which will be put to good use. Tan R. said that a few novices will likely be going forth to becoming monks soon so they will definitely use the cloth. In fact because face masks are in short supply, Tan Ajahn said that he donated one of the rolls to the Ubon province so they could be used to make cloth face masks.
