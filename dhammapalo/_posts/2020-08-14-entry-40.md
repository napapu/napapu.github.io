Today it was Tan M., Tan T. and myself on Non Suan for the alms round. They walked so fast it was hard to catch up and they never looked back. It was an act of sheer folly to try and catch up during all parts of the walk. The only way to do it was to simply lag a little behind on the painful parts and then speed up as much as possible on the nicer roads.

Not much happened in the afternoon and hopefully a sign that I'm finally getting into it. I took a nap and then read some books that I took out of the library. Today I changed the water in the moat surrounding the bowl drying shed because it needs to be done every few days to prevent mosquitoes from laying their eggs. There were still a million mosquitoes there anyway though.

It happened again. The big tukkae got inside somehow. I'm lost. The towel was there beneath the door and it didn't look moved. The big hole in the wall was blocked too. Maybe it's finally time to check out kuti 33 because it's a concrete one so lizards won't be a problem. However I'm sure that there will be other problems to complain about like insects. There's no harm in checking anyway.
