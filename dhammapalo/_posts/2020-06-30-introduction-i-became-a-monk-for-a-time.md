It's been over three months since my 2-month temporary ordination in Thailand and I've been meaning to talk to people about it in a bit more detail. At the time there was a belief or hope that COVID would quickly disappear and I'd be back on familiar shores. Now the only certainty is that it's likely to remain for a while, which would also mean the same for my own circumstances.

In that case I thought it might be a good idea to do some writing up of that time just in case it might be valuable to anyone. It's not often that one becomes a Buddhist monk following the Thai Forest tradition but most importantly, I kept a diary during that period. My sister wanted me to do this much earlier but I had delayed mostly out of laziness and desire to do other things so hopefully this will at least satisfy her, should no one else ever come across this.
