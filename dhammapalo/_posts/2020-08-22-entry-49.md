Today was Luang Por Anek's birthday and a big group went to Wat Pah Sai Ngam which is not too far from WPN. I decided not to go because I wanted to go tomorrow to Phra That Phanom and two trips in a row would be too much. Also apparently Luang Por Anek gives really long Dhamma talks before the meal and I would likely be the only monk squirming in pain from sitting in papiap.

It rained heavily for the first time since I've come here and the weather cooled down a lot. It felt much more comfortable doing chores and evening chanting. How wonderful that one appreciates even the smallest things as a monk.
