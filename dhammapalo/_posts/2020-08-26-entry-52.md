Today did not start off well as I didn't get much sleep last night. Not many people turned up for morning chanting either. This made the morning chores harder because I had to help Nen P. carry the big chairs used for last night's Dhamma talk back to the office as well as clean the sala floors as usual. The alms round itself felt more painful in general which I think was related to the fatigue. The double layer kept coming undone as I didn't have time to do it properly.

Sangha Tea was much more interesting than usual as Tan Ajahn spoke about the Dhamma talk last night. Then followed a long discussion about many different topics comparing Buddhism and Christianity, and how one would fit into the other from each other's perspective. There was also a question about how one might prove or suggest that rebirth exists. Fascinating overall with input from many different people.
