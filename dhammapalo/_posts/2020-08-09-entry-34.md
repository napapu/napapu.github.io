Last night I was so exhausted by the time I got back that I didn't have time to do any of the chants. The sleep was awful as well. Maybe I should've cleaned my room or not drank so much fluids during Nam Pana. It did get a lot colder again so I might try closing all the windows tonight.

I decided to attend evening chanting early so I could get some extra time to meditate. It worked out really well I think as I felt more energised straight after Nam Pana and showering so the freshness certainly helped with concentration. Plus I'm finding it difficult to meditate at any other time anyway.
